Goal
Safely remove unused chart types (radial, gauge, area) from the codebase without breaking anything else.

Non-goals
- Do NOT touch charts that are still used.
- Do NOT remove shared utilities that other charts depend on.

Step 1 — Inventory & Proof (NO edits yet)
- List every file, export, and component related to: radial chart, gauge chart, area chart.
- For each item, show:
  - All importers (files/lines) OR “no importers found”
  - Any dynamic imports, string-based lookups, or registry-based references
  - Any Storybook/demo-only references
- Produce a dependency graph snippet (import graph) for these chart items.
- If any item is used by a shared util (e.g., color scales, formatters), FLAG it as shared and exclude from removal.

Step 2 — Plan (NO edits yet)
- Propose a minimal, reversible plan:
  - If truly unused: move files to `client/deprecated/charts/<type>/` first (quarantine)
  - Update any `index.ts` barrels to remove re-exports
  - After green checks, optionally delete quarantined files in a second commit
- List exactly which files will be moved or edited, with expected line deltas (aim net-negative).

Guardrails
- No edits outside chart modules and their barrels.
- Do NOT modify logic in shared utilities; only remove references to unused charts.
- Keep diffs SMALL (moved/removed lines only).
- If any ambiguity remains about usage, STOP and ask.

Step 3 — Implementation (Quarantine first)
1) Move unused files to `client/deprecated/charts/<type>/` (radial, gauge, area).
2) Remove their exports from any `index.ts`/barrel files.
3) Ensure any routes/docs/storybook entries referencing them are updated or removed if unused.

Step 4 — Verification (must pass)
- Type check: `tsc -noEmit`
- Lint: `eslint .`
- Tests: `npm test -s` (or project test command)
- Unused exports scan: run `ts-prune` (or equivalent) and report for chart-related modules
- Import graph: run `madge` or `depcruise` on chart folders; confirm no broken edges/new cycles
- App smoke: start dev server, load all pages that render charts you DO use; confirm they render as before.

Output
- Inventory table (file → importers count; dynamic usage? yes/no)
- Minimal plan (bullets)
- SMALL unified diffs:
  - Barrel/index edits removing exports
  - File moves (renames) to deprecated/
- Verification results (pass/fail with brief notes)
- Post-fix audit:
  - Confirm no references remain to radial/gauge/area outside deprecated/
  - Confirm no shared utils were removed
  - Document how to permanently delete `client/deprecated/charts/**` after a release

Stop conditions
- Any sign of dynamic usage or registry lookup of these charts
- Any failing type/lint/test result
- Any touched file outside the chart modules or barrels

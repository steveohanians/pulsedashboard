Business Logic for AI-Powered Analytics Dashboard
Purpose: Deliver clear, timely, and strategic performance insights using GA4 data, benchmark comparisons, and AI-generated recommendations. The system is designed for efficiency, automation, and alignment with Clear Digital’s service model.

1. 📆 Timeframe Logic
The dashboard always reflects the most recently completed full month.

Example: If today is August 3, the dashboard shows data for July.

Do not fetch or display current-month data.

2. 📊 Data Fetching and Storage (GA4) — Clients Only
a. Timeframe Scope & Retention
Data retention is indefinite (forever) — the system stores GA4 data permanently.

On initial setup, fetch up to 15 months of historical data, if it does not already exist.

b. Ongoing Monthly Fetch Logic
On the first day of each new month:

Fetch daily data for the newly completed month.

Condense the previous month's daily data into a single monthly summary value and store that.

This helps reduce storage while preserving monthly trends.

Do not modify existing monthly data from prior periods unless reprocessing is manually triggered.

c. Daily vs. Monthly Granularity
Most recent full month: Store daily data to support detailed charting.

Older months: Store a single summarized monthly value per metric.

d. Monthly Rollover Behavior
At the beginning of each month:

Fetch new month’s daily GA4 data.

Condense previous month’s daily data to monthly.

Clear:

All AI-generated insights from prior month

Any user-provided context tied to prior month

Prepare the dashboard for manual insight generation.

e. Data Isolation
Fetching real GA4 data for the client must never affect benchmark, competitor, or portfolio data in storage or visualization. These datasets remain fully independent.

3. 🧠 AI Insight Generation Logic
a. Trigger Points
Insights are only generated manually via “Generate Insights” or “Regenerate” button.

b. Structure
Each insight includes:

Context – What the metric means + current performance

Insight – Strategic interpretation

Recommendations – Three actionable, concise bullets

c. Output Requirements
Follow prompt template rules for structure, tone, length, and formatting

Use client’s name explicitly

Bold key metrics and recommendation actions

4. 🧠 User-Provided Context Integration
Users may input strategic context (e.g., KPIs, campaign updates)

Input is sanitized and tied to the current month only

On monthly rollover:

Clear user-provided context

Require re-entry for new month

5. 🧪 Sample Data Logic (Benchmarks, Competitors, Portfolio)
a. Sample Data Generation
Generate 15 months of realistic time-series data for:

Competitors

Benchmark companies

Clear Digital portfolio

Requirements:

Mimic GA4 metric behavior

Show reasonable monthly fluctuations

Use existing predefined generation methods (no invented logic)

b. Competitor Management
On add: Generate historical sample data (15 months)

On delete: Remove that competitor’s sample data entirely

c. Data Isolation
Creating or modifying sample data (for benchmarks, competitors, or portfolio) must never affect client GA4 data or visualizations.

d. Future Integration
Eventually, all sample data for benchmarks, competitors, and portfolio will be sourced from SEMrush, structured to match Google Analytics (GA4) format.

6. 📁 Final Data Storage & Maintenance Summary
Data Type	Granularity	Retention	Behavior
GA4 Metric Data (Client)	Daily (latest month), Monthly (past months)	Forever	Fetch 15-month historical on setup; fetch new daily data monthly; condense previous month to monthly
AI-Generated Insights	Monthly	1-month rolling	Cleared on monthly rollover
User-Provided Context	Monthly	1-month rolling	Cleared on monthly rollover
Benchmark Sample Data	Monthly	Forever	Generated once per addition
Competitor Sample Data	Monthly	Forever	Re-generated on add/delete
Portfolio Sample Data	Monthly	Forever	Generated on setup, static unless reset

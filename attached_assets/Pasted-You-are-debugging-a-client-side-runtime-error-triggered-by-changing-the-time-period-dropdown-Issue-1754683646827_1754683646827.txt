You are debugging a client-side runtime error triggered by changing the time-period dropdown.

Issue
- Error overlay: "[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] The object can not be found here."
- Trigger: Clicking the "Last month" option in the time-period dropdown on the dashboard.
- Expected: Updating charts/tables to "last month" without errors.

Repro steps
1) Start dev server (`npm run dev`) and open the dashboard root route (/).
2) Click the time-period dropdown and select "Last month".
3) The Vite overlay appears with the error above.

Scope boundary
- Only touch files directly tied to the dropdown → selection handler, state/store for period, and any mapping/formatter used by that UI.
- Candidate files to inspect (do NOT edit yet): 
  - client/src/components/** (time period dropdown component)
  - client/src/utils/dateUtils.ts
  - client/src/utils/timePeriodsGenerator.ts
  - Any local hook/store that holds selectedPeriod
- Do NOT modify server code, routes, or unrelated utilities.

Guardrails (anti-bloat)
- Make the MINIMUM change to fix the crash.
- Reuse existing helpers; do NOT add new parallel utilities.
- No renames/moves except if essential to fix. 
- Logging: allow at most ONE temporary concise console.log during diagnosis; remove it in the final patch.

Step 1 — Investigation ONLY (no edits)
- Capture the full stack trace and the exact line/column via source maps.
- Identify the failing call chain from the dropdown onChange → handler → period computation → consumers.
- Show the specific object/field that is undefined/null or otherwise invalid (files/functions/line numbers).
- Check the mapping for "last month" and verify it returns a valid structure (start/end, label).
- Verify the selectedPeriod type matches what downstream consumers expect (e.g., {start,end,label}).
- Note any mismatch with timePeriodsGenerator/dateUtils or stale imports after refactors.

Output now:
- Root cause summary (2–3 bullets)
- Evidence: code excerpts w/ file paths and line numbers
- Minimal fix plan (1–3 bullets). Do not implement yet.

Step 2 — Implementation (only after plan shown)
- Apply the smallest change that fixes the crash (e.g., fix mapping key, guard undefined, correct import, align type/shape).
- Show a SMALL unified diff (only changed lines).
- Remove any temporary logs.

Step 3 — Verification
- Type check: `tsc -noEmit`
- Lint: `eslint .`
- Tests (if present): `npm test -s`
- Runtime smoke: run the repro steps in the browser, confirm the overlay does not appear and data updates correctly for "Last month", "This month", and one additional option.

Output format
- Root cause
- Diff (changed lines only)
- Rationale (2–3 sentences)
- Verification results (commands + pass/fail)
- Post-fix audit: confirm no unrelated files changed, no unused imports/vars/logs remain.

Stop conditions
- Any uncertainty about the cause → ask me before changing code.
- Any required public API change to shared utilities.

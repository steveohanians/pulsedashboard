Please analyze and fix the Industry_Avg charting issues in our dashboard. Industry_Avg data is not displaying correctly on charts while CD_Avg works fine.

ISSUES TO FIX:

1. DATA STRUCTURE ISSUE in /server/storage.ts:
   - In getFilteredIndustryMetrics() function (lines 651-746)
   - Traffic Channels generation is being SKIPPED (line 717: "continue;")
   - This causes Traffic Channels chart to have no Industry_Avg data
   - CD_Avg works because it doesn't skip and has proper fallback data

2. SCALING INCONSISTENCIES between Industry_Avg and CD_Avg:
   - Percentages: Sometimes 0-1 scale (0.45) vs 0-100 scale (45)
   - Session Duration: Sometimes minutes vs seconds
   - Value wrapping: JSON objects {"value": X} vs raw values
   - Device Distribution: Inconsistent percentage formats

REQUIRED FIXES:

1. In /server/storage.ts - getFilteredIndustryMetrics():
   - REMOVE the skip for Traffic Channels generation (line 717)
   - Generate Traffic Channels data similar to how other metrics are generated
   - Ensure consistent value format: use 0-100 for percentages, seconds for duration

2. In /server/services/semrush/dataProcessor.ts:
   - Ensure calculateIndustryAverages() outputs consistent scaling:
     * Bounce Rate: 0-100 scale (45 for 45%)
     * Session Duration: always in seconds (180 for 3 minutes)
     * Traffic Channels percentages: 0-100 scale
     * Device Distribution percentages: 0-100 scale
   - Match the exact format that CD_Avg uses

3. In chart components (/client/src/components/charts/):
   - Add normalization functions to handle both formats during transition
   - Ensure stacked-bar-chart.tsx handles Industry_Avg Traffic Channels
   - Ensure lollipop-chart.tsx handles Industry_Avg Device Distribution

4. Create consistency check function to verify:
   - All Industry_Avg metrics match CD_Avg format
   - All percentages are 0-100 scale
   - All durations are in seconds
   - Traffic Channels have complete channel arrays

TEST CRITERIA:
- Industry_Avg should display on ALL charts just like CD_Avg does
- Traffic Channels stacked bar chart shows Industry_Avg data
- Device Distribution lollipop chart shows Industry_Avg data
- No scaling issues (values should be similar magnitude to CD_Avg)
- Time series charts show proper Industry_Avg trends

SPECIFIC CODE SECTIONS TO MODIFY:

1. /server/storage.ts lines 715-720:
   Replace:
   ```javascript
   if (config.name === 'Traffic Channels') {
     continue; // Skip traffic channels
   }
With proper Traffic Channels generation using the same approach as other metrics.

Ensure all stored values use consistent format:

Percentages: Always store as 0-100 (e.g., 45.5 not 0.455)
Duration: Always store in seconds (e.g., 180 not 3)
Use same JSON structure as CD_Avg for complex values



Please make these fixes and verify that Industry_Avg data displays correctly on all dashboard charts.

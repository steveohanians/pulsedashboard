  Created New Files

  - /client/src/components/loading/types.ts - Core LoadKit
  interfaces and types
  - /client/src/components/loading/constants.ts - Loading
  thresholds and configuration
  - /client/src/components/loading/LoadingSpinner.tsx -

  Environment Variables Added

  - REACT_APP_LOADKIT_ENABLED=true - Feature flag for LoadKit
  system
  - REACT_APP_LOADKIT_CARDS=true - Feature flag for card-level
   loaders
  - VITE_LOADKIT_ENABLED=true - Vite-compatible feature flag

  Updated Files

  Loading System Integration:
  - /client/src/components/effectiveness-card.tsx - Replaced 5
   loading states with standardized ButtonLoadingSpinner
  - /client/src/components/metric-insight-box.tsx - Fixed
  button spinner colors, removed manual loading states
  - /client/src/components/loading/ButtonLoadingSpinner.tsx -
  Added text-white class for visibility on gradient buttons
  - Multiple other components - Systematically replaced old
  loaders with LoadKit system

  Competitor Deletion Fix:
  - /server/routes.ts - Completely rewrote competitor deletion
   endpoint with proper cascade deletion:
    a. Delete criterion scores for effectiveness runs
    b. Delete effectiveness runs for competitor
    c. Delete metrics for competitor
    d. Delete competitor record
  - /client/src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts - Enhanced deletion
  success handler with global cache invalidation

  Cleanup:
  - Removed all debug logging from LoadKit components
  - Reverted red button styling added during troubleshooting
  - Cleaned up unnecessary console.log statements

  Key Technical Achievements

  1. Standardized Loading Experience - All loaders now use
  consistent styles, sizes, colors, and progress text
  2. Fun Copy System - Added rotating motivational messages
  during AI insight generation with 3-second delay and fade
  transitions
  3. Zero-Risk Deployment - Feature flag system allows safe
  rollout and easy rollback
  4. Fixed Competitor Deletion - Resolved foreign key
  constraint violations with proper cascade deletion order
  5. Improved Cache Management - Global query invalidation
  ensures all UI components update consistently

  The system now provides a unified, professional loading
  experience across the entire application while maintaining
  backward compatibility through feature flags.

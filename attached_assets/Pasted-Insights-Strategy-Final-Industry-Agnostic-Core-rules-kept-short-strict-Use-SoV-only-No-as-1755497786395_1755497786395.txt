Insights & Strategy (Final, Industry-Agnostic)
Core rules (kept short & strict)

Use SoV only. No assumptions.

Competitor average excludes “Others.” Report “Others” separately as fragmentation signal.

Thresholds:

Absent = presence 0% in stage

Underperforming = brandSoV + 5 percentage points < competitor avg

Strong = brandSoV ≥ competitor avg − 5pp

Insufficient data = <3 questions in stage

Prioritize by largest positive gap (competitor avg − brand SoV), then Decision → Consideration → Awareness.

Output each insight as: Title → Rationale (with % + N) → Action → Clear Digital deliverables.

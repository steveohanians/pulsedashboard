1. Backend or Data Pipeline Bottlenecks
❗️Slow API response from OpenAI or AI model
If you're calling GPT-4 or another model to generate insights on load, that call may take 5–20+ seconds, especially with longer prompts or larger outputs.

Fix: Use caching or generate insights in advance (on save or on schedule), not at render time.

❗️Uncached competitive data lookups or benchmarks
Pulling industry averages or competitor data from external APIs or databases on demand can introduce latency.

Fix: Pre-fetch and cache benchmarks server-side.

❗️Heavy synchronous processing
Performing things like scoring, formatting, or merging AI + metrics in real time can freeze response flow.

Fix: Move heavy processing to a background job or batch process.

🧮 2. Database / Query Inefficiency
❗️Unoptimized queries
If you’re joining large tables, filtering on unindexed fields, or querying every metric at once, this can drag performance.

Fix: Use indexed views, lazy loading, or pre-aggregated results.

❗️Lack of result caching
If every page view triggers full query execution without Redis/memory caching, you’re adding load you don’t need.

Fix: Cache by client+metric hash or daily digest.

🎨 3. Frontend Rendering Issues
❗️Rendering large DOM structures or complex charts
Libraries like D3.js, Chart.js, or Recharts can get expensive if rendering too many data points or using unnecessary animation.

Fix: Limit render scope per panel; use lightweight charting libs or virtualized rendering.

❗️Loading too much JSON or insight text before page interactivity
If insight text or data blocks are injected in bulk into the DOM before DOMContentLoaded, it can block render.

Fix: Lazy-load insights per section or asynchronously hydrate them post-render.

🌐 4. Network & Request Timing
❗️Sequential API calls
If you're making insight > benchmark > competitor > format calls in sequence, the latency compounds.

Fix: Parallelize async calls with Promise.all.

❗️Client waiting for server-side rendering
SSR with slow data fetching = full page delay.

Fix: SSR the shell and hydrate insights client-side.

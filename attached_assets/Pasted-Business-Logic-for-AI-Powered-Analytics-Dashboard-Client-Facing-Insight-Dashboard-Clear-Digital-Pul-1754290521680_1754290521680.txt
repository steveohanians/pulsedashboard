Business Logic for AI-Powered Analytics Dashboard
Client-Facing Insight Dashboard (Clear Digital Pulse™)
Purpose: Provide clients with strategic, competitive, and performance-based insights through a monthly dashboard powered by GA4 data, benchmark comparisons, and AI-generated analysis.

1. 📆 Timeframe Logic
The dashboard is always based on the most recently completed full month.

Example: If today is August 3, display metrics for July.

Do not fetch or show partial-month (e.g., current month) data unless explicitly requested.

2. 📊 Data Fetching and Storage (GA4)
a. Timeframe Scope
Maintain data covering the past 15 months (rolling window).

b. Fetch Strategy
Before fetching new GA4 data, always:

Check if the required data already exists locally (in DB or cache).

If yes, use the cached version instead of calling GA4.

c. Granularity Handling
For the current or most recent full month:

Store daily data (used for detailed insights and AI generation).

For older months:

Summarize daily data into a single monthly value per metric.

Replace daily records with monthly summary (or archive if needed).

This balances granularity with performance.

d. Supported Metrics (example set, not exhaustive)
Bounce Rate

Session Duration

Pages per Session

Sessions per User

Traffic by Channel

Traffic by Device

Conversion metrics (if applicable)

3. 🧠 AI Insight Generation Logic
a. When Insights Are Generated
Insights are pre-generated when new data is ingested (not on dashboard load).

Insights can also be manually regenerated or edited.

b. Structure of Each Insight Block
Context: What the metric means + how the client performed relative to benchmark/competitors.

Insight: Patterns, competitive gaps or advantages.

Recommendation: 3 strategic, scannable bullets with actionable suggestions.

c. Prompt Behavior
Insights must:

Use the client’s name (not “the client”).

Be concise: under 120–150 words total.

Use bold for key metrics and actions.

Avoid phrases like “score” for ratio-based metrics (e.g., Sessions per User).

Avoid generic phrases like “improve experience”; provide specific, realistic suggestions.

d. Recommendation Personalization
Recommendations should subtly reflect Clear Digital’s service capabilities, such as:

UX/UI enhancements

Analytics & tracking improvements

Content strategy

Visual design optimization

Technical infrastructure (e.g., CMS, platform speed)

These should not be branded or promotional, but described naturally (e.g., “refine brand voice” not “Brand Messaging Service”).

4. 🧠 User-Provided Context Integration
Users can optionally add custom context (e.g., KPIs, recent campaigns).

When present:

This context is appended to the prompt.

It should influence insights and recommendations without overriding core data.

The user input is linted:

Stripped of unsafe content (e.g., script tags, prompt injection).

Filtered for profanity and off-topic entries.

Limited to 2000 characters.

5. 📈 Visualizations & Data Display
Graphs must show true time-series data (e.g., daily or weekly trends over last month).

Do not repeat single static values across date ranges.

Show:

The client’s actual metric

Industry benchmark

Clear Digital portfolio average

Key competitor performance

Visuals must match the selected granularity (e.g., daily for July, monthly for previous months).

6. 🔁 Regeneration, Editing & Versioning
Users can:

Copy, delete, or regenerate insights

Add manual context and regenerate

Past insights are stored and editable per metric/month/client

Insight text should persist unless explicitly regenerated

- **Request Queuing**: Prevents backend overwhelming during concurrent operations
- **Progressive Error Handling**: User-friendly messages with actionable recovery steps

### üé® **User Experience Excellence**  
- **Progressive Toast Notifications**: Fun, informative messages during long-running analysis
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars with percentage and time estimates
- **Navigation State Preservation**: Seamless browser refresh recovery
- **Comprehensive Accessibility**: Full screen reader and keyboard navigation support

### üîí **Security & Validation**
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS protection and malicious content filtering
- **Data Validation**: Type-safe API responses with graceful fallbacks  
- **Bounds Checking**: Score validation and array limits to prevent attacks
- **Safe URL Handling**: Protocol validation and length limits

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimization**
- **React Memoization**: Optimized re-renders with useMemo and useCallback

## üîß Architecture Improvements

### **State Management Pattern**
```typescript
// Atomic operations prevent race conditions
const EffectivenessStateManager = {
  handleTimeout: async (runId) => {
    // Atomic state update with rollback capability
    return this.atomicUpdate(runId, 'timeout');
  }
}
```

### **Error Handling Strategy**  
```typescript  
// Layered error boundaries with recovery
<EffectivenessErrorBoundary>
  <EffectivenessCard />
</EffectivenessErrorBoundary>
```

### **Performance Pattern**
```typescript
// Comprehensive memoization
const statusCalculations = React.useMemo(() => ({
  isAnalyzing: status?.includes('analyzing'),
  isCompleted: status === 'completed'  
}), [status]);
```

### **Accessibility Pattern**
```tsx
<div 
  role="progressbar"
  aria-valuemin={0}
  aria-valuemax={100}
  aria-valuenow={progressPercentage}
  aria-labelledby="progress-status"
>
```

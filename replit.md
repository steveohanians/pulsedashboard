# Pulse Dashboard™

## Overview
Pulse Dashboard™ is a full-stack analytics benchmarking dashboard designed for Clear Digital's B2B clients. Its core purpose is to deliver AI-powered web analytics insights by benchmarking client performance against competitors, industry averages, and Clear Digital's portfolio. The system integrates with Google Analytics 4 and other external data sources to provide comprehensive web analytics and actionable recommendations, aiming to enhance client performance through competitive benchmarking and ultimately improve their overall digital presence.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Filter ordering: Business sizes ordered small to large, industry verticals alphabetical.
Dynamic filtering: Industry filters reference each other - selecting a business size filters available industry verticals and vice versa.
Performance priority: Demands enterprise-grade performance with immediate loading capabilities to replace 22+ second load times.
Data management principles: Dashboard shows "Last Month" data only (not current partial month). Follow established 15-month historical data logic: check existing data before re-fetching, summarize daily to monthly for storage optimization, only fetch new/active months not yet pulled.
Learning principles: Follow established patterns and logic instead of creating new approaches. When modifying data, only touch the specific entities requested - never assume broader changes are needed.
Data integrity principles: NEVER show fake, sample, or fallback data under any circumstances. Show empty states rather than synthetic data to maintain authentic data integrity. Completely eliminate all fallback data generators.

## System Architecture
Pulse Dashboard™ employs a modern full-stack architecture with a clear separation between frontend, backend, and data layers, emphasizing performance, data integrity, and scalability.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Charts**: Recharts

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **Authentication**: Passport.js (local strategy, session-based via connect-pg-simple)

### Database
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM

### Key Components and Design Patterns
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based session authentication with role-based access control (Admin/User).
- **Data Models**: Structured around Clients, CD Portfolio Companies, Benchmark Companies, Competitors, Users, Metrics, Benchmarks, and AIInsights.
- **API Architecture**: Segregated into Public, Admin, Data Ingestion, and AI Integration endpoints.
- **Data Flow**: Automated ingestion, processing, normalization, and analytics pipeline.
- **Security Features**: Robust session security, rate limiting, comprehensive security headers, structured authentication logging, Zod schema-based input validation, and Scrypt hashing.
- **Production Readiness**: Health checks, structured logging, comprehensive error handling, templated email service integration, and environment-driven configuration.
- **White-Label Capability**: Designed for flexible deployment with centralized configuration and dynamic company branding.
- **AI Prompt System**: Centralized AI prompt management with executive-optimized output formatting (max 120 words) and server-side input sanitization.
- **GA4 Integration Architecture**: Clients provide GA4 Property ID and grant guest access; Clear Digital uses Google service account for API access. Automated ETL transforms GA4 data.
- **Data Management**: Intelligent 15-month data fetching system with storage optimization, existing data checking, and automatic replacement of daily with monthly data for GA4 and SEMrush. Includes a complete data sync package for 15 months.
- **Performance Optimization System**: Reduces load times through intelligent caching, parallelized database queries, background AI processing, chart optimization, database indexing, and connection pooling.
- **Authentic Data Integration**: Ensures authentic Google Analytics 4 and SEMrush data with automatic access token refresh. Never shows fake, sample, or fallback data; employs empty states to maintain data integrity.
- **Unified Device Model**: Standardized device distribution across GA4 and SEMrush to Desktop + Mobile.
- **Portfolio Integration**: Enhanced portfolio averages calculation with robust error handling, logging, and data validation, including an intelligent `CD_Avg` historical data system.
- **Company Management**: Comprehensive company deletion system, robust company creation and validation including duplicate domain checking and SEMrush API health checks.
- **Metrics Schema**: Overhauled with `cd_portfolio_company_id` and `benchmark_company_id` for proper three-way linking.
- **Global Chart Data Processing Architecture**: Extracted fetching, parsing, fallback, and conversion logic into reusable `chartDataProcessor.ts` utilities.
- **AI Insights Persistence**: Database-backed insights loading for persistence across sessions and page refreshes. Enhanced AI context for traffic channels and comprehensive JSON parsing.
- **Utility Consolidation**: Systematic consolidation and refactoring of utility functions across the application to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

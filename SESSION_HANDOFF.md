# Session Handoff Documentation

## 🎯 Current Status (COMPLETED)
The client effectiveness analysis system is **fully functional**:
- ✅ Screenshots displaying correctly in evidence drawer
- ✅ Core Web Vitals showing actual metrics (LCP: 0.76s, CLS: 0.02, FID: 0ms)
- ✅ Progress bar working during analysis
- ✅ All data integration fixed

## 🔧 Recent Fixes Applied

### 1. Screenshots Fix
**Problem**: Evidence drawer showing broken screenshot links
**Root Cause**: UI was looking for `evidenceData.run.screenshotUrl` but data was in `currentRunData.screenshotUrl`
**Fix**: Updated `/home/runner/workspace/client/src/components/evidence-drawer.tsx` to use correct data source

### 2. Web Vitals Fix  
**Problem**: All web vitals showing "Not available"
**Root Cause**: Web vitals stored in speed criterion evidence, not run-level data
**Fix**: Added `extractWebVitals()` helper function in evidence drawer to extract from speed criterion
**Location**: `/home/runner/workspace/client/src/components/evidence-drawer.tsx:44-51`

## 🚀 Next Development Phase Options

### Priority 1: Competitor Analysis Implementation
- **Status**: Basic structure exists but not implemented
- **Location**: `/home/runner/workspace/server/services/EffectivenessService.ts:228-238`
- **Goal**: Add competitor effectiveness scoring for side-by-side comparisons

### Priority 2: AI Insights Generation
- **Status**: Mentioned in system but not implemented  
- **Goal**: Generate actionable recommendations based on effectiveness scores
- **Integration**: Analyze criterion results and provide improvement suggestions

### Priority 3: Real-time UI Updates
- **Status**: User mentioned needing to refresh for updates
- **Goal**: WebSocket/polling for live progress without refresh

## 📊 Current API Endpoints
- `GET /api/effectiveness/latest/:clientId` - Returns complete effectiveness data
- `POST /api/effectiveness/analyze/:clientId` - Starts new analysis
- Screenshots served from `/screenshots/` static path

## 🗄️ Database Schema
- `effectivenessRuns` - Main run records with overall scores
- `criterionScores` - Individual criterion results with evidence
- Web vitals stored in speed criterion evidence.details.webVitals

## 🔍 Key Files Modified
1. `/home/runner/workspace/client/src/components/evidence-drawer.tsx` - Fixed data sources
2. Evidence drawer now correctly extracts:
   - Screenshots from `currentRunData`
   - Web vitals from speed criterion evidence

## 🎮 Test Commands
```bash
# Start development servers
NODE_ENV=development npm run dev  # Backend on :5000
# Frontend is integrated in same server

# Test API
curl http://localhost:5000/api/effectiveness/latest/demo-client-id

# Check screenshots
ls /home/runner/workspace/screenshots/
```

## 📝 Architecture Notes
- Uses tiered execution: HTML analysis → AI analysis → External APIs
- Enhanced scorer with checkpoint recovery and smart timeout management
- Progressive results with real-time callbacks
- Evidence stored as JSON in criterion scores

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps
1. **Choose focus area** (competitor analysis recommended)
2. **Verify current fixes** work in browser
3. **Implement chosen feature** following existing patterns
4. **Add tests** for new functionality

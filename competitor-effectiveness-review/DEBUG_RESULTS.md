# Debug Results Summary

## Storage Function Test
âœ… `storage.getCompetitorsByClient('demo-client-id')` works correctly
- Returns 2 competitors: baunfire.com and clay.global

## Recent Effectiveness Runs
```
Latest 3 runs for demo-client-id:
2b15c1c3-5450-445e-a69c-110d7c597123: completed - Client - Sun Aug 31 2025 19:38:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)
2d2f0cf7-141e-472e-92b7-18281ba2f85c: failed - Client - Sun Aug 31 2025 19:19:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)  
146c93de-5147-4151-a1ec-7e0db05244ce: completed - Client - Sun Aug 31 2025 19:00:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)
```

## API Testing Issues
- Unauthenticated curl requests return HTML (frontend router)
- Authenticated requests from dashboard work but competitor trigger is broken
- POST /api/effectiveness/demo-client-id/refresh returns 200 but no logs appear

## Screenshot Optimization Applied
```typescript
// OLD: 30s + 70s + 30s = 130+ seconds max
// NEW: 15s + 25s + 15s = 55s max
signal: AbortSignal.timeout(15000) // API timeout
signal: AbortSignal.timeout(25000) // Full-page timeout  
timeout: 15000 // Playwright timeout
```

## Key Finding
The 7:38 PM client run completed successfully but did NOT trigger competitor scoring, while the 5:49 PM run correctly triggered 2 competitor runs at 5:50 PM.

This suggests the async competitor block in effectivenessRoutes.ts is either:
1. Not being reached after client scoring
2. Failing silently with an unhandled error
3. Being blocked by some condition check

================================================================================
1. SOV (SHARE OF VOICE) PROMPT TEMPLATE
================================================================================

You are generating a reusable set of 15 buyer-stage questions to measure brand mentions (share of voice) in ChatGPT across ANY vertical and ANY mix of companies (services, SaaS, hardware, platforms, etc.).

INPUTS
- {vertical} = the industry or market.
- {brandContext} = includes the primary {brand} and a list of {competitors}.

NORMALIZE BRAND NAMES
- Convert all brand and competitor names to clean, human-readable names:
  • Strip protocols/domains from URLs (e.g., "https://example.com" → "Example").
  • Use Title Case for brand names (e.g., "example" → "Example").
  • Preserve multi-word spacing (e.g., "Example Company" not "ExampleCompany").
- Refer to the primary brand as {brand} and competitors as an ordered list {competitors_list}. 

SOLUTION TYPE
- Infer a general "solution type" from {brandContext} (e.g., "digital design and branding services," "marketing automation platforms," "medical imaging devices").
- If unclear, use a neutral label like "solutions" or "services" appropriate to the {vertical}.

STRUCTURE (15 QUESTIONS TOTAL)
AWARENESS STAGE (5)
- 3 ORGANIC (brand-agnostic): Broad challenges, benefits, or outcomes.
- 1 ORGANIC discovery (solution-seeking): Must elicit vendor/brand names without seeding specific brands. Use ONE of these templates:
  • "Who are the leading providers of {solution_type} for {vertical} companies?"
  • "Which companies specialize in delivering {solution_type} to {vertical} businesses?"
  • "Which vendors are most recognized for {solution_type} in the {vertical} industry?"
- 1 PROMPTED (multi-brand): Name ALL brands together (the {brand} plus ALL competitors). Use clean list phrasing, Oxford comma, and "and" before the last brand. Avoid "along with".

CONSIDERATION STAGE (5)
- 3 ORGANIC (brand-agnostic): Criteria, trade-offs, evaluation frameworks, features. Cover cost, quality, integration, scalability, usability. Vary phrasing (what/which/why/how/list/scenario).
- 2 PROMPTED:
  • 1 MULTI-BRAND: Compare ALL listed brands together with clean phrasing:
    – "How do {brand}, {competitor1}, and {competitor2}{, …} differ in their approach to {X}?"
    – "What are the key differences between {brand}, {competitor1}, and {competitor2}{, …} when it comes to {Y}?"
  • 1 PAIRWISE (PRIMARY-BRAND ANCHORED, ROTATION RULE): Must be {brand} vs. ONE competitor.  
    – Use natural phrasing like:  
      "Between {brand} and {competitorX}, which is stronger at {topic}?"  
      "Which is better for {scenario}: {brand} or {competitorX}?"  
    – Rotation Rule: If multiple competitors exist, pair with the **first competitor** in the list for this stage.

DECISION STAGE (5)
- 2 ORGANIC (brand-agnostic): Practical purchase considerations—pricing, ROI measurement, implementation, customer support, scalability, integration.
- 3 PROMPTED:
  • 1 MULTI-BRAND: Compare ALL listed brands together (clean phrasing as above).
  • 2 PAIRWISE (PRIMARY-BRAND ANCHORED, ROTATION RULE):  
    – Must be {brand} vs. TWO different competitors.  
    – If only 1 competitor exists, use {brand} vs. {competitor1} twice, with distinct topics.  
    – If 2 competitors exist, use {brand} vs. {competitor1} and {brand} vs. {competitor2}.  
    – If 3 competitors exist, use {brand} vs. {competitor2} and {brand} vs. {competitor3}.  
    – If more than 3 competitors exist, prioritize the first three for pairwise; include ALL competitors in multi-brand prompts.
  • CONTENT REQUIREMENTS (Decision PROMPTED):
    – At least ONE pairwise must explicitly reference ROI/measurable financial results (e.g., revenue growth, lead generation, cost efficiency).  
    – At least ONE (pairwise or multi-brand) must address post-purchase support and/or scalability.

PAIRWISE COVERAGE LOGIC (ROTATION RULE, FOOLPROOF)
- Consideration: {brand} vs. {competitor1}.  
- Decision: {brand} vs. {competitor2} and {brand} vs. {competitor3} (if available).  
- Ensures that across Consideration + Decision, each competitor appears exactly once in a pairwise when there are 3 competitors.  
- If fewer than 3 competitors, reuse as needed with distinct topics.  
- If more than 3 competitors, rotate across runs; each run prioritizes the first three.

STYLE & QUALITY RULES
- Use natural buyer language; avoid marketing jargon.
- Vary question forms across the set (what/how/why/which/lists/scenario-based).
- Avoid duplicates; each question must be meaningfully distinct.
- Keep ORGANIC questions strictly brand-agnostic (no seeded names).
- PROMPTED questions must include brand names as specified (multi-brand or primary-brand pairwise).
- Use clean multi-brand phrasing: "{brand}, {competitor1}, {competitor2}, and {competitor3}".
- Avoid clunky constructs like "and … along with …".

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
- Provide stage headers exactly as:
  Awareness Stage (5 questions)
  Consideration Stage (5 questions)
  Decision Stage (5 questions)
- Then a numbered list (1–15) with each question tagged:
  1. [ORGANIC] …
  2. [PROMPTED] …
- Do NOT include any commentary or explanations outside the list.

GENERATE NOW
- First, normalize brand names from {brandContext}.
- Then, produce the 15 questions following ALL rules above.


================================================================================
2. CTA (CALL-TO-ACTION) PROMPT
================================================================================

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an expert CTA (call-to-action) evaluator. Think silently; return ONLY valid JSON.

PROMPT TEMPLATE:
ROLE
You are a strict evaluator of **Calls to Action (CTAs)** on a B2B page. Return ONLY valid JSON per the schema. No extra text.

INPUT
{content}  // plain copy; optionally includes a screenshot image. If an image is present, run OCR.

SCOPE
- Parse the plain copy in {content}.
- If a screenshot image is present, perform OCR and merge OCR text with the copy for CTA detection.
- Treat copy and OCR text as equivalent evidence.
- Do NOT infer CTAs from shapes, colors, or buttons without readable text.

TEXT HANDLING
- Build two strings:
  1) original_text: unchanged (for evidence quotes).
  2) cta_text: original_text + OCR text (if any), concatenated. Collapse whitespace to single spaces; preserve punctuation.
- For CTA detection, **do NOT** apply any "ignore CTA" lists elsewhere in your system.

CTA TAXONOMY (case-insensitive; punctuation-tolerant; match whole phrases allowing minor punctuation/spacing)
PRIMARY (conversion intent)
- demo: "book demo", "request demo", "schedule a demo", "get a demo"
- contact/sales: "talk to sales", "contact sales", "contact us", "let's talk", "lets talk", "speak to an expert"
- pricing/quote: "request quote", "get quote", "request pricing", "get pricing", "see pricing"
- start/signup: "get started", "sign up", "start trial", "start free", "start free trial", "try free", "try it free"
- download/subscribe/consult: "download", "subscribe", "request consultation", "request a consultation", "book a consultation", "join waitlist", "apply now"

SECONDARY (exploratory/navigation)
- "learn more", "read more", "see our work", "view case study", "read the latest", "see all", "explore", "discover", "browse"

SYNONYM GROUPS (for reinforcement vs. conflict)
- demo: {book/request/schedule/get a demo}
- contact: {talk to sales, contact sales, contact us, let's/lets talk, speak to an expert}
- pricing: {request/get quote, request/get/see pricing}
- start: {get started, sign up, start/try free/trial}
- download: {download}
- subscribe: {subscribe}
- consult: {request/book consultation}
- waitlist: {join waitlist}
- apply: {apply now}
Two phrases in the same group are considered **synonymous** (no conflict).

BLOCK-LEVEL SEGMENTATION (for "next step" closure)
1) Split text into lines in original order (use OCR line order if image).
2) A **heading** starts a block if ANY is true:
   - 3–12 words, Title Case (≥60% words capitalized) OR ALL CAPS (≥70% letters uppercase)
   - Ends with ":"
   - Matches common section cues (case-insensitive): about, approach, method, process, services, solutions, products, outcomes, results, case studies, clients, testimonials, industries, resources, insights, why, how, history, values, mission, vision, pricing, plans, contact
3) A **major block** = heading line + following non-empty lines until next heading or a blank line.
   Ignore blocks with <3 lines OR <120 characters.

POSITIONAL WINDOWS (use both character and line windows; if either matches, condition holds)
- **Above-the-fold (early)**: first 35% of lines OR first 1500 characters of the full page text.
- **Page-end (terminal)**: last 25% of lines OR last 250 characters of the full page text.
- **Block-end (closure)**: last 2 lines OR last 150 characters within a major block.


NAVIGATION RECOGNITION (special handling)
- CTAs found within navigation, header, menu, or nav elements are ALWAYS considered above-the-fold.
- If text includes phrases like "nav", "menu", "header" near a CTA, treat it as above-the-fold.
- If OCR shows blank/white areas at page top but text includes navigation-related CTAs, assume these are above-the-fold.
DETECTION RULES
- A CTA "occurs" where a PRIMARY/SECONDARY phrase appears (case-insensitive; punctuation-tolerant).
- **Block closure**: a PRIMARY CTA occurs in a block-end window.
- **Early availability**: a PRIMARY CTA occurs in the above-the-fold window.
- **Page-end closure**: a PRIMARY CTA occurs in the page-end window.

CTA STRENGTH SCORE (0.00–1.00 in 0.25 steps; clamp to [0,1]; round to two decimals)
+0.25 Presence & clarity: ≥1 PRIMARY CTA anywhere.
+0.25 Early availability: a PRIMARY CTA in the above-the-fold window.
+0.25 Closure: EITHER (a) page-end closure OR (b) ≥1 major block has block closure.
+0.25 Reinforcement: ANY of:
   - ≥2 distinct major blocks have block closure, OR
   - Same/synonymous PRIMARY CTA appears ≥2 times across the page, OR
   - One PRIMARY + one SECONDARY CTA both present.

CONFLICT RULE
- If ≥2 **different** PRIMARY groups (per Synonym Groups) occur with similar frequency (difference ≤1 occurrence),
  subtract 0.25 (floor at 0.00) and add "cta_conflict" to extraction_issues.
- Do NOT count SECONDARY CTAs as conflicts.

NO-PRIMARY RULE
- If only SECONDARY CTAs exist, set cta_present=false and award at most **+0.25** if they appear in page-end or block-end windows
  (use Reinforcement = false and Early = false). Add "no_primary_cta" to extraction_issues.

IMAGE/OCR RELIABILITY GUARDRAIL
- If an image is present:
  * Compute ocr_status:
    - "failed" if OCR chars < 50 OR alphanumeric ratio < 0.3 with no stopword signal.
    - "degraded" if not failed AND (OCR chars < 300 OR unique-word ratio < 0.2 OR heavy repetition).
    - "ok" otherwise.
  * **Never penalize CTA score for degraded/failed OCR.** Compute CTA positions from page copy; use OCR only to ADD evidence (e.g., confirm a footer "Let's talk").
  * If image present and ocr_status ≠ "ok", add "visual_cta_unassessed" to extraction_issues.
  * If visual OCR is blank/degraded but text content contains CTAs in early positions (first 1500 chars), trust the text content for positional determination.

OUTPUT (JSON only; keys exactly as below)
{
  "cta_present": boolean,                      // true if ≥1 PRIMARY CTA found
  "cta_primary_examples": array,               // up to 3 distinct PRIMARY phrases (verbatim from original_text/OCR)
  "cta_secondary_examples": array,             // up to 3 SECONDARY phrases (optional; [] if none)
  "cta_above_fold": boolean,                   // primary CTA seen in early window
  "cta_page_end": boolean,                     // primary CTA seen in terminal window
  "cta_block_closure": boolean,                // at least one major block closes with a PRIMARY CTA
  "cta_block_examples": array,                 // up to 3 block headings/snippets showing closure
  "cta_strength_score": number,                // 0.00–1.00 (0.25 steps), rounded to 2 decimals
  "cta_evidence": string or null,              // brief rationale e.g., "Above-fold 'Get a demo'; block closure in 'Services'; page-end 'Let's talk'."
  "primary_cta_groups_used": array,            // e.g., ["contact","demo"]
  "cta_conflict": boolean,                     // true if conflict rule applied
  "ocr_status": "ok" | "degraded" | "failed" | null,
  "extraction_issues": array                   // e.g., ["cta_conflict","no_primary_cta","visual_cta_unassessed"]
}

PROCESS
1) Build original_text and cta_text (plus OCR text if any).
2) Segment into lines; identify major blocks via headings.
3) Find PRIMARY and SECONDARY CTA occurrences (with synonym grouping).
4) Compute early, page-end, and block-end windows; set booleans accordingly.
5) Score cta_strength_score per rules; apply conflict deduction if needed; clamp and round.
6) Populate outputs with verbatim examples from original_text/OCR and concise cta_evidence.
7) Return exactly one JSON object.


================================================================================
3. BRAND STORY PROMPT
================================================================================

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an expert B2B brand strategist evaluator. Think silently; return ONLY valid JSON.

PROMPT TEMPLATE:
ROLE
You are a strict evaluator of brand story content. Return ONLY valid JSON per the schema. Do not include explanations or extra text.

INPUT
{content} 

SCOPE & SOURCES
- Inputs may be: plain copy (no HTML) and optionally a screenshot image.
- You MUST:
  1) Parse the copy in {content}.
  2) Perform OCR on any provided image and treat on-image copy as textual evidence.
- Treat copy and OCR text as equivalent sources for evidence.
- Do NOT infer visuals from section names or assumed layout. If no image, visuals cannot be evaluated.
- Do NOT follow links or assume content from other pages.

UNIVERSALITY GUARDRAILS
- Be industry-agnostic. Do not favor software/tech terminology over other sectors (manufacturing, healthcare, finance, energy, logistics, professional services, public sector, etc.).
- Examples are illustrative, not exhaustive. If a term fits the rule, count it, even if it's unfamiliar or sector-specific.
- Named clients count as proof even if you don't recognize the brand.
- Certifications/compliance are sector-agnostic (e.g., ISO, SOC, HIPAA, PCI, GMP, ITAR, FedRAMP, CE, LEED, IEC, OSHA, SSAE, etc.). Treat any explicitly named, relevant certification or standard as proof.
- Metrics are locale-agnostic: any currency, units, or numeric formats (%, decimal separators, k/m/b abbreviations) qualify.

TEXT PREPROCESSING
Maintain two versions:
1) original_text: unchanged, used for verbatim evidence quotes.
2) cleaned_text (for detection only):
   - Remove: ™, ®, ©
   - Collapse whitespace; trim leading/trailing whitespace.
   - Trim leading/trailing punctuation: . , : ; — – - | / …
   - Ignore CTA/navigation phrases (case-insensitive, whole-word):
     get started, learn more, contact, pricing, sign in, log in,
     book demo, request demo, schedule a demo, get a demo,
     start free, start trial, try free, talk to sales,
     view case study, see our work, read insight, let's talk
   - Detection is case-insensitive; all evidence must be quoted from original_text or OCR.

HEADLINE/SECTION CUES (copy-only)
- Without HTML, identify headline candidates as the most declarative line (5–30 words) expressing purpose/stance or summarizing the brand (e.g., "Results-driven websites and digital brand experiences.").
- Use section cues in text (e.g., "Testimonials", "Clients", "Case Study", "Certifications") ONLY to classify proof (not visuals).

VISUAL ANALYSIS (image-dependent ONLY)
- If an image is provided, run OCR and compute visual_hierarchy_score in 0.25 steps (0.00–1.00):
  +0.25 Brand story visibility: story content is prominently positioned/readable in the screenshot.
  +0.25 Visual storytelling: imagery supports narrative (team photos, timeline, values/icons, diagrams, product/solution visuals).
  +0.25 Content hierarchy: clear headings/structure visible.
  +0.25 Supporting proof: testimonials, client logos/names, awards/certs, or case-study cards visible.
- If NO image is provided OR OCR fails, set visual_hierarchy_score=0.00 and visual_supports_story=false. Add "no_image" or "ocr_failed" to extraction_issues as applicable.

EVALUATION PRINCIPLES
- Evidence must be explicit in copy or OCR text. Do NOT infer audience/outcomes/mechanism from visuals or section titles alone.
- Distinguish strictly:
  * OUTCOMES = numeric + result keyword in the SAME PHRASE (e.g., "42% increase in session duration", "ROI in 6 months", "reduced defects by 30%", "cut lead time by 10 days").
    - Accept tokens: %, currency, units, k/m/b abbreviations, plain digits.
    - Result keywords (non-exhaustive, cross-industry): increase, decrease, reduce, cut, lift, improve, boost, grow, accelerate, save, eliminate, optimize, achieve, deliver, ROI, margin, conversion(s), leads, pipeline, revenue, cost(s), spend, uptime, yield, throughput, capacity, utilization, cycle time, lead time, time-to-*, defects, error rate, scrap, safety incidents, SLA, compliance, CO2(e), NPS, retention, churn.
    - EXCLUDE firmographics/tenure alone (e.g., "20+ years", "500 clients") from outcomes.
    - Testimonials only count as outcomes if they contain a numeric result.
  * PROOF = credibility (named clients, testimonials, case-study mentions, awards/certifications/compliance, tenure, press mentions, partnerships).
- If borderline, choose FALSE.

EVALUATION CRITERIA (binary; no partial credit)

1) pov_present (boolean)
   TRUE if a clear point of view/stance/purpose is explicit (e.g., "We help [audience] achieve [outcome]", "We believe…", "We're committed to…").
   FALSE for generic service lists.
   Extract exact phrase from original_text/OCR or null.

2) mechanism_named (boolean)
   TRUE if a specific approach/method/process is named (e.g., "design thinking", "API-first", "lean six sigma", "our 3-step process", "risk-based methodology").
   FALSE for vague "innovative approach".
   Extract exact phrase or null.

3) outcomes_stated (boolean)
   TRUE only if a numeric token appears WITH a result keyword in the same phrase (per rules above).
   FALSE for directional promises or tenure/scale without results.
   Extract exact phrase or null.

4) proof_elements (boolean)
   TRUE if any credibility indicator exists in copy/OCR: named clients, testimonials, case-study mentions, awards/certifications/compliance, partnerships, tenure ("20+ years"), press.
   Extract the most specific phrase or null.

5) visual_supports_story (boolean)
   TRUE only if an image is provided AND visual_hierarchy_score ≥ 0.50 AND visuals clearly support the narrative (per Visual Analysis).
   FALSE if no image or score < 0.50.
   Extract brief note referencing visible elements, or null.

SCORING & CONFIDENCE
- 5 binary criteria (1–5). No partial credit.
- confidence is fixed by number of TRUEs:
  - 1.0 (5), 0.8 (4), 0.6 (3), 0.4 (2), 0.2 (1), 0.0 (0 or empty/generic).
- visual_hierarchy_score must be in [0.00, 1.00], two decimals. If not, clamp and add "invalid_visual_score" to extraction_issues.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only; no extra text)
{
  "pov_present": boolean,
  "pov_evidence": string or null,
  "mechanism_named": boolean,
  "mechanism_evidence": string or null,

PROCESS
1) Build cleaned_text; keep original_text for quotes.
2) Identify headline/section cues from copy.
3) Evaluate criteria 1–4 strictly from copy/OCR text (no layout inference).
4) If image exists, run OCR and compute visual_hierarchy_score; else set to 0.00 and visual_supports_story=false.
5) Output exactly one JSON object.


================================================================================
4. POSITIONING PROMPT
================================================================================

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an expert B2B positioning evaluator. Think silently; return ONLY valid JSON.

PROMPT TEMPLATE:
ROLE
You are a strict evaluator of sections. Return ONLY valid JSON per the schema. Do not include explanations or extra text.

INPUT
{content}

SCOPE & SOURCES
- content may include: extracted HTML of the hero area, plain text, and optionally a screenshot image.
- You MUST:
  1) Parse the HTML/text in {content}.
  2) Perform OCR on any provided image and treat on-image copy as textual evidence.
- Treat HTML/text/OCR text as equivalent sources for evidence. Do not infer from imagery alone.

TEXT PREPROCESSING
Create two versions:
1) original_text: unchanged, used for verbatim evidence quotes.
2) cleaned_text: used for detection; apply:
   - Remove characters: ™, ®, ©
   - Collapse whitespace to single spaces; trim leading/trailing whitespace.
   - Trim leading/trailing punctuation from lines: . , : ; — – - | / …
   - Ignore CTA phrases (case-insensitive, whole-word match):
     get started, learn more, contact, pricing, sign in, log in,
     book demo, request demo, schedule a demo, get a demo,
     start free, start trial, try free, talk to sales
   - Detection is case-insensitive; evidence quotes must come from original_text or OCR text.

HEADLINE DETECTION
- Prefer HTML <h1>. If absent, use first <h2>. If neither exists, choose the best candidate from OCR or text:
  - A single line likely acting as a headline (≥5 and ≤30 words), distinct from navigation/CTA.
- Extract headline_text from original_text/OCR (not cleaned_text).
- Word count rule: split by whitespace; hyphenated words count as one.

VISUAL ANALYSIS (only if an image is provided)
Compute visual_hierarchy_score deterministically in 0.25 steps (0.00–1.00):
+0.25 Above-the-fold hero: banner at top and clearly primary.
+0.25 Headline prominence: largest/highest contrast vs body/nav.
+0.25 Positioning emphasis: headline/value prop visually emphasized (size/weight/contrast/placement).
+0.25 Supporting proof: product UI, diagram, logos, or focused imagery reinforcing the claim.
If no image: visual_hierarchy_score=0.00.

EVALUATION PRINCIPLES
- Evidence must be explicit in text or OCR'd on-image text. Do NOT infer audience/outcome/capability from visuals.
- When multiple candidates exist, choose the most specific, unambiguous phrase.
- Non-English text: evaluate using the same rules.

EVALUATION CRITERIA (binary; no partial credit)

1) audience_named (boolean)
   TRUE if target customer is explicitly identified by any of:
   - Industry (e.g., "for healthcare", "for retail")
   - Role (e.g., "for marketers", "for CTOs")
   - Size (e.g., "for enterprises", "for startups", "for SMBs/SMEs", "mid-market", "scaleups")
   - Combination (e.g., "for B2B SaaS companies", "for Fortune 500")
   FALSE for generic terms like "for businesses", "for companies", "for teams", "for everyone".
   Extract: exact phrase from original_text/OCR or null.

2) outcome_present (boolean)
   TRUE if a specific benefit/result is stated pairing an action verb with a measurable object.
   Verbs (non-exhaustive): reduce, decrease, cut, increase, boost, grow, improve, raise, accelerate, speed up, save, eliminate, streamline.
   Measurable objects (non-exhaustive): cost(s), revenue, pipeline, leads, conversion(s), time, errors, efficiency, risk, churn, productivity.
   Percentages/time frames strengthen but are optional.
   FALSE if only features (e.g., "AI-powered", "all-in-one", "innovative").
   Extract: exact phrase or null.

3) capability_clear (boolean)
   TRUE if the company's function is explicit via product/service + domain/category
   (e.g., "CRM software", "payment processor", "analytics platform", "marketing agency", "IT consulting").
   FALSE if only generic terms ("platform", "solution", "services", "software") with no category/domain.
   Extract: exact phrase or null.

4) brevity_check (boolean)
   TRUE if headline_text (per Headline Detection) is ≤ 30 words.
   Evidence: "X words: [headline text]" or null.

5) visual_supports_positioning (boolean)
   TRUE if an image is provided AND:
     - visual_hierarchy_score ≥ 0.50, AND
     - imagery/layout clearly reinforces the textual positioning (e.g., product UI, relevant diagram, credible logos), OR the headline/value prop is visually emphasized consistent with the claim.
   FALSE if no image is provided or criteria above are not met.
   Extract: brief evidence note referencing visible elements, or null.

SCORING & CONFIDENCE
- There are 5 binary criteria (1–5). No partial credit.
- confidence is fixed by count of TRUEs:
  - 1.0 for 5 TRUE
  - 0.8 for 4 TRUE
  - 0.6 for 3 TRUE
  - 0.4 for 2 TRUE
  - 0.2 for 1 TRUE
  - 0.0 for 0 TRUE or empty/generic input
- Round visual_hierarchy_score to two decimals.

  "confidence": number
}

PROCESS
1) Build cleaned_text from HTML/text/OCR; keep original_text for quoting evidence verbatim.
2) Detect headline_text.
3) Evaluate criteria 1–4 from explicit text/OCR only.
4) If image exists, compute visual_hierarchy_score and evaluate criterion 5; otherwise set score=0.00 and criterion 5 = FALSE.
5) Produce the JSON object exactly as specified.

# Continuation Prompt for Next Session

## ðŸŽ¯ Context Setup
Hi Claude! I need you to continue developing an effectiveness analysis system. The client functionality is now fully working - screenshots display correctly in the evidence drawer and web vitals show actual performance metrics instead of "Not available".

## ðŸ“‹ What to do first:
1. **Read the handoff doc**: `cat /home/runner/workspace/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`
2. **Start the dev server**: `NODE_ENV=development npm run dev` (runs on port 5000)
3. **Verify current state**: Test API with `curl http://localhost:5000/api/effectiveness/latest/demo-client-id`

## ðŸš€ Primary Mission: 
**Implement Competitor Analysis**

The system currently only analyzes the main client website. I want to add competitor effectiveness scoring to enable side-by-side comparisons.

### Key Implementation Points:
- Extend `/home/runner/workspace/server/services/EffectivenessService.ts:228-238` (currently just a placeholder)
- Add competitor scoring using the same tiered execution system
- Update frontend to display client vs competitor comparisons
- Store competitor results in same database schema structure

### Technical Approach:
1. **Backend**: Extend `processCompetitors()` method to run effectiveness analysis on competitor URLs
2. **Database**: Use existing `effectivenessRuns` table with `competitorId` field populated 
3. **Frontend**: Add comparison view in evidence drawer or new component
4. **API**: Extend existing endpoints to include competitor data

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria:
- Run effectiveness analysis on both client and competitor websites
- Display side-by-side comparison of scores
- Show competitor screenshots and web vitals
- Enable switching between client and competitor evidence

## ðŸ’¡ Alternative Mission (if competitor analysis seems complex):
**Implement AI Insights Generation** - Generate actionable recommendations based on effectiveness scores and evidence.

## ðŸ”§ System Architecture:
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with TypeScript, Drizzle ORM
- **Frontend**: React components integrated in same server
- **Database**: SQLite with effectiveness runs and criterion scores
- **Analysis**: Tiered execution (HTML â†’ AI â†’ External APIs) with OpenAI

Start with the handoff doc, verify everything works, then dive into competitor analysis implementation following the existing patterns!
